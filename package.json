    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Bugfix: Occasional precision issue when camera rotation is exactly 180 degress, causing rotational flickering.\n- Bugfix: Deceleration at the end of axis range was too aggressive.\n- Bugfix: Orbital recentering should not be forced when transitioning to a camera.\n- Bugfix: InheritPosition takes the actual camera position, so it works consistently if transitioning mid-blend.\n- Bugfix: CinemachineDeoccluder was causing a pop when OnTargetObjectWarped was called.\n- Bugfix: Spurious camera cut events were being issued, especially in HDRP.\n- Bugfix: Null reference exceptions when inspector is hidden behind another tab.\n- Bugfix: GroupFraming inspector was displaying incorrect warning when LookAt target is a group.\n- Bugfix: GroupFraming displays more accurate group size indicator in the game view.\n- Bugfix: nullrefs in log when target group was deleted but was still being referenced by vcams.\n- Regression fix: CinemachineCollider generated NaN positions if no target was set.\n\n### Added\n- New sample: ThirdPersonWithAimMode showing how to implement a FreeLook camera with Aim mode.\n- Added Recentering Target to OrbitalFollow.  Recentering is now possible with Lazy Follow.\n- Added API in Deoccluder and ThirdPersonFollow to access which collision objects are impacting the camera position.\n- Added ICinemachineTargetGroup.IsValid property to detect deleted groups.\n- Added option to disable deltaTime scaling in CinemachineInputAxisProvider.\n\n### Changed\n- Improved OrbitalFollow's ForceCameraPosition algorithm.\n- Deoccluder accommodates camera radius in all modes.\n- Renamed CinemachineSplineDolly.CameraUp to CameraRotation, which more accurately reflects what it does.\n- Renamed InputAxis.DoRecentering() to InputAxis.UpdateRecentering()\n- StateDrivenCamera: child camera enabled status and priority are now taken into account when choosing the current active camera.\n\n### Deprecated\n- Removed CinemachineToolSettings overlay."
