    "changelog": "### Fixed\n- Bugfix: index out of range exception when adding a Cm Shot to a timeline track whose CinemachineBrain is inactive.\n- Bugfix: OrbitalFollow with 3-ring setup would inappropriately damp in respose to vertical input if LookAt and Follow were at different vertical positions.\n- Bugfix: StateDrivenCamera min activation time was broken.\n- Bugfix: Solo not updating when brain is in FixedUpdate.\n- Bugfix: Spline roll was being calculated incorrectly when spline was rotated.\n- Bugfix: \"Freeze When Blending Out\" didn't work when switching betwen two cameras multiple times.\n- Bugfix: Cinemachine cameras would sometimes unnecessarily dirty the scene due to floating-point imprecision when setting transform rotations.\n\n### Added\n- Added CinemachineDecollider to resolve camera intersection with colliders and terrains, without necessarily preserving line-of-sight to target.\n- CinemachineDeoccluder has the option to resolve towards the Follow target instead of the LookAt target.\n- Added CinemachineShotQualityEvaluator which is a standalone version of the evaluation code in Deoccluder.\n- Added StateDrivenCamera.CancelWait() method to cancel the current wait on a pending state change.\n- Added FlyAround sample scene showing a simple fly-around camera.\n- Added IgnoreTimeScale option to InputAxisControllerBase.\n- Added confirmation dialog when exiting play mode, if Save During Play is enabled and changes have been made to saveable properties.\n\n### Changed\n- SplineDolly and SplineCart: position on spline is preserved when units change.\n- SimplePlayerAimController sample upgraded to work on arbitrary surfaces (no longer depends on world up).\n- SimplePlayerController sample has logic to avoid input gimbal lock when player is upside-down relative to the camera.\n- PlayerOnSphere sample is now PlayerOnSurface - can walk on arbitrary surfaces.\n- Axis recentering happens independently on axes with differing recentering tmes, so that input on one axis does not impact the recentering state of the others.\n- FreeLookOnSphericalSurface sample is improved, adding a moving surface and second camera.\n- Replaced SameAsFollowTarget with RotateWithFollowTarget (SameAsFollowTarget still exists but is deprecated).\n- Deoccluder evaluates shots in the Finalize stage instead of Aim."
