    "changelog": "### Added\n- Added CinemachineVirtualCameraBaseEditor, to facilitate making conformant inspectors for custom virtual cameras and virtual camera managers.\n- Added Padding option to CinemachineConfiner2D.\n- Added CinemachineSplineSmoother for creating smooth splines suitable for camera paths.  This replicates the behaviour of CinemachineSmoothPath in CM2.\n- Added Easing option to CinemachineSplineRoll.\n- Added SaveDuringPlay support to CinemchineSplineRoll.\n- Added preference option to show spline normals instead of the railroad-track gizmo.\n\n### Changed\n- The presence of a tracking target no longer affects whether the CinemachineCamera state's position and rotation are pushed back to the transform.\n- TargetPositionCache.GetTargetPosition() and TargetPositionCache.GetTargetRotation() are now public, so that custom classes can support cached timeline scrubbing.\n\n### Bugfixes\n- Sometimes a deeply-nested passive camera's position would creep due to precision inaccuracies.\n- When coming out of a cutscene, sometimes the original camera would fail to be restored.\n- Spline roll direction was inverted.\n- The upgrader sometimes failed to delete all obsolete components.\n- The path upgrader was creating knots using Broken instead of Mirrored mode, and was not setting knot rotations correctly.  This resulted in spline Up vectors not always being smooth."
