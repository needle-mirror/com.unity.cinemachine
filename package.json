    "changelog": "### Bugfixes\n- Deoccluder did not always properly reset its state.\n- Deoccluder and Decollider were introducing spurious damping when the FreeLook orbit size changed.\n- Mac only: Some dropdowns and popups in Cinemachine inspectors did not work consistently.\n- Regression fix: Confiner2D was not always confining when a camera was newly activated.\n- RotationComposer and PositionComposer no longer damp in response to composition changes from the FreeLookModifier.\n- Fixed sample asset selection at import depending on current render pipeline and input configuration.  You need to re-import the samples to fix any existing issues.\n- Confiner2D was behaving inconsistently for large sized bounding boxes due to precision issues.\n- StateDrivenCamera inspector was not populating the states in the instruction list correctly.\n- Fixed a number of issues causing ForceCameraPosition to not behave as expected.\n- Maximizing an inspector which contained custom blends would generate console errors and cause the inspector to be unresponsive.\n\n### Changed\n- Cinemachine Shot Editor for Timeline no longer displays improper UX to create cameras when editing a prefab.\n- The game-view composer guides dynamically reflect the current composition when a FreeLookModifier is changing it.\n- When a FreeLookModifier is enabled for composition, the game-view composer guides are no longer draggable.\n \n### Added\n- Added Easing setting to FreeLookModifier, to smooth the transition between top and bottom FreeLook hemispheres.\n- Added an overload for `CinemachineBrain.ManualUpdate` which takes a custom frame count and deltaTime, allowing more customized control over the game loop.\n- Added `CINEMACHINE_TRANSPARENT_POST_PROCESSING_BLENDS` scripting define to tune the PostProcessing blend behaviour.\n- Added Signal Combination Mode to Impulse Listener, to allow combining multiple impulse signals in different ways."
