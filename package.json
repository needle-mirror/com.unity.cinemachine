    "changelog": "### Added\n\n- Progress bar added to Cinemachine Upgrader.\n- CinemachineDeoccluder is a new class, not just a rename of CinemachineCollider.\n- CinemachineAutoFocus extension is now available for built-in and URP pipelines, with reduced functionality compared to HDRP.\n- Camera.focusDistance is driven by CM when the camera is in physical mode.\n- Confiner2D provides API to adjust the confiner to the current window size when the lens or aspect changes.\n- TargetGroup now ignores members whose gameObjects are inactive.\n- Cinemachine Samples can import their package dependencies.\n- CinemachinePathBase search radius fixed for not looped paths.\n- Add SplineAutoDolly.ISplineAutoDolly.Reset() method and SplineAutoDolly.Enabled flag.\n- Confiner2D and Confiner3D support smooth stop at bounds edge.\n- URP: add temporal effects reset on camera cut.\n- Add Weight setting to CinemachinePostProcessing and CinemachineVolumeSettings.\n- GroupFraming also works on LookAt target.\n- Several new Sample scenes were added.\n\n### Changed\n\n- Improved performance of CINEMACHINE_EXPERIMENTAL_DAMPING algorithm.\n- Path gizmo drawing was optimized.\n- Confiner2D does less gc alloc.\n- CinemachineSmoothPath is upgraded to Splines correctly now.\n- InputAxis refactor for recentering and momentary axis support.\n- CinemachineIndependentImpulseListener renamed to CinemachineExternalImpulseListener.\n- CmCamera is now CinemachineCamera.\n- The SimpleFollowWithWorldUp binding mode has been renamed to LazyFollow.\n- CinemachineExtension API changes to VirtualCamera, GetAllExtraStates, OnTargetObjectWarped, and ForceCameraPosition.\n- Third person shooter sample use object pooling for the projectiles.\n\n### Deprecated\n\n- CinemachineConfiner is deprecated.  New behaviour CinemachineConfiner3D to handle 3D confining.  Use CinemachineConfiner2D for 2D confining.\n- 3rdPersonFollow and 3rdPersonAim are deprecated and replaced by ThirdPersonFollow and ThirdPersonAim respectively.\n\n### Fixed\n\n- Regression fix: POV and PanTilt handle ReferenceUp correctly.\n- Bugfix: Lens blending was wrong.\n- Bugfix: CinemachineDeoccluder Pull Forward strategy only pulls forward even with Camera Radius bigger than 0.\n- Bugfix: Extensions were not respecting execution order on domain reload.\n- Bugfix: AxisState was not respecting timescale == 0.\n- Bugfix: priority ordering was wrong when the difference between any priority values were smaller than integer min or bigger than integer max values.\n- Bugfix: Very occasional axis drift in SimpleFollow when viewing angle is +-90 degrees.\n- Bugfix: Physical lens settings were not being properly applied."
